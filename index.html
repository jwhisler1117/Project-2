      <h2>Proposition</h2>
      <p><strong>Complaints against the NYPD disproportionately involve Black complainants suggesting racial profiling.</strong></p>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>
            This heatmap highlights how complaint intensity remains consistently highest for Black complainants
            across two-year periods from 2000–2019.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Used a red color palette to evoke urgency and highlight higher counts of complaints.</li>
          <li>Grouped years into 2-year blocks to reduce clutter especially along the x-axis. Also reduced the number of groups by combining 'Unknown' and 'Not Reported' into 'Unknown'
                and also 'Refused' and 'Declined to Answer' into a single 'Refused' </li>
          <li>Dominant dark-red band visually directs attention toward Black complainants.</li>
          <li>-0.5 Score (slightly deceptive) as noted the dark-red band for Black complainants intentionally dominates the plot. Other racial groups complaint increases can be seen but visually much more subtle.</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Line Chart.png"
            alt="Line chart showing ratio of Black vs All Other complainants, 2010–2019."
          />
          <figcaption>
            The line chart displays a steady decline in the ratio of Black to All Other complainants from
            2010–2019, implying that racial disparities may be improving over time.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Used a soft blue line to create a neutral and analytical appearance, reducing emotional bias.</li>
          <li>Limited the range to 2010–2019 to focus on recent progress and imply ongoing improvement.</li>
          <li>Transformed the data into ratios using Black complaints versus all other groups to show a lower perceived disparity.</li>
          <li>-1.0 Score (deceptive) as this plot only chooses data from 2010-2019 where a overall reducted of % of Black complainants can be seen. The plots 
              being in ratio form may also deceive a viewer to think Black complaints are going down when in reality the raw count of Black complaints has remained relatively consistent over the decade but the number of overall complaints
              has increased.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>

<h2>Final Reflection</h2>
<p>
  Working on this project showed me how much data transformations and design choices can change the story a
  chart tells. For the <strong>FOR</strong> the Proposition heatmap, I grouped complaints into two-year periods
  and cleaned up the ethnicity labels so the data was more consistent. I also filled missing values with “Unknown.”
  Those steps made the chart less overwhelming but still kept the focus on showing how Black complainants dominate
  the overall number of complaints. For the <strong>AGAINST</strong> the Proposition line chart, I filtered the years
  down to 2010–2019 and calculated a new ratio comparing Black complainants to everyone else. That made the trend look
  clearer, but it also framed the data in a way that could make the disparities seem smaller than they really are.
</p>

<p>
  The two visualizations tell opposite stories even though they come from the same dataset. The heatmap uses red tones
  and total counts to draw attention to how consistently high the number of Black complainants has been, suggesting
  possible racial bias. The line chart uses softer blues and a limited range to show what looks like progress. Neither
  one is “wrong,” but they push the viewer to focus on different parts of the truth. I didn’t realize before just how
  much power color, scale, and framing have to shape what people believe they’re seeing.
</p>

<p>
  This assignment made me rethink what “ethical visualization” means. To me now, it’s about being transparent about
  the choices you make — what data you include, how you transform it, and what context you leave out. It’s fine to make
  persuasive visuals if you’re honest about how they were built and what they really show. It crosses the line when
  design choices hide important context or make something look more extreme (or more positive) than the data supports.
  The hard part isn’t making a chart that looks good — it’s making one that tells the truth without pretending to be
  neutral.
